*An interactive Query Relaxation Framework for the Empty-Answer problem.*


This framework is part of a research project and is intentended for research although it can be used as a library. 
It is distributed freely, with the corresponding acknowledgement to the authors.

Davide Mottin, Alice Marascu, Senjuti Basu Roy, Gautam Das, Themis Palpanas, and Yannis Velegrakis. 2013. **A probabilistic optimization framework for the empty-answer problem.** *Proc. VLDB Endow. 6, 14 (September 2013)*.

## Required libraries

The framework requires the [ExecUtils v2.0](https://github.com/mutandon/ExecutionUtilities/releases/tag/v2.0) to run. 

## Version and details

This version of the framework includes top-*k* relaxations and cardinality constraints included in a publication under submission. 

It has been optimized to run on boolean databases, although many data models are allowed (but not implemented).

Data used in the experiments are available upon request. 

## How it works

The main file to run experiments is *TestFramework*. More details will come in the next revision of this file or upon request.
